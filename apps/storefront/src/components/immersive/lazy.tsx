 * The immersive client components, each split into its own chunk. The page

 * components directly, so a store page without a shader hero, a 3D product, a
 * turning carousel or a scroll story never downloads their code — and a page
 * with one downloads only that one. They still render on the server (the
 * default for next/dynamic), so nothing pops in after load; the heaviest
 * piece, three.js behind the 3D viewer, is loaded later still, only when a
 * shopper opens the model (Product3D → ModelViewer).
